Power 2048 (Custom Base Version)

Website: https://tony-hack1014.github.io/power2048/

Power 2048 is a custom twist on the classic 2048 puzzle game.  
Instead of doubling numbers, each tile follows powers of a chosen base: **2, 3, 4, or 5**.

This makes the game feel fresh while also helping players naturally learn and recognize exponential values.  
Just like how many people instantly recognize **512** as a power of 2 after playing 2048, this version helps build intuition for powers of 3, 4, and 5 as well.

## Base Progression Targets

The final tile for each base follows:
-2 => 2^10 (2048)
-3 => 3^8 (6561)
-4 => 4^8 (65536)
-5 => 5^7 (78125)

By playing repeatedly, the exponents start to feel familiar —  
you begin to “just know” that 243 = 3⁵ or 15625 = 5⁶.  
The game becomes both a puzzle and a way to build number sense.
