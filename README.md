Power 2048 (Custom Base Version)

This is a custom version of 2048 where tiles follow powers of a chosen base (2–5).
For now, the game is set to base 3, with tiles going from 3¹ up to 3⁸ (6561).

The goal is to learn and practice:

Grid logic (sliding, merging, spawning)

Clean game architecture

Input handling (keyboard + swipes later)

Basic game UI

Preparation for building a real offline/mobile game

Current Status

Basic project structure created

Empty 4×4 grid renders on screen

Ready to start adding the actual game logic

File Structure
index.html  – main layout
style.css   – visual styling
game.js     – grid rendering + future game logic
README.md   – project notes

Next Steps

Implement the grid system in JavaScript

Add random tile spawning

Build move + merge logic for all directions

Add scoring, restart, base selection, etc.
